**[macOS-RestartSyncroAgent.sh](https://github.com/SyncroScripting/Artichoke_Consulting/blob/main/macOS/bash/macOS-RestartSyncroAgent.sh)** - Since the macOS SyncroMSP Agent doesn't have a "Restart Agent" function, Here's one for you all. It's a bit involved as calling the agent to restart itself ends in failure, so to achieve the restart we write and load a LaunchDaemon and a self-removing restart script.
